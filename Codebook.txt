**Extracting measurements on the mean and std for each measurement**

For this purpose it is assumed that the measurements are:

	-tBodyAcc-XYZ
	-tGravityAcc-XYZ
	-tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
	-tBodyGyro-XYZ
	-tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
	-tBodyAccMag
	-tGravityAccMag
	-tBodyAccJerkMag
	-tBodyGyroMag
	-tBodyGyroJerkMag
	-fBodyAcc-XYZ
	-fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
	-fBodyGyro-XYZ
	-fBodyAccMag
	-fBodyAccJerkMag
	-fBodyGyroMag
	-fBodyGyroJerkMag

Note: It is known that such list of signals where extracted with several methods from the raw data of the two sensors. 

In consequence only the mean and standard deviation of such listed signals where extracted. Estimations that included the word mean, but really were a different estimation on its own (and not a mean/standard deviation calculation) where ignored. For example “fBodyAcc-meanFreq()-X” or “angle(tBodyAccJerkMean),gravityMean)”. In general the following estimations where ignored:

	-mad(): Median absolute deviation 
	-max(): Largest value in array
	-min(): Smallest value in array
	-sma(): Signal magnitude area
	-energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
	-iqr(): Interquartile range 
	-entropy(): Signal entropy
	-arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
	-correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
	-maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
	-meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
	-skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
	-kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
	-bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
	-angle(): Angle between to vectors.


**Creating descriptive variable names *

Based on the “features.txt” file, which lists the complete list of columns names, more complete labels were created. The proposed new names have the following structure with each section englobed by squared brackets and separated by  “_”: [Signal Domain Type]_[Source Of Movement (Body or Gravity)]_[Sensor Name (Accelerometer or Gyroscope)]_[Jerk Measurement Flag (if it applies)]_[Axis name or Magnitude Flag]_[Estimation Name (Mean or Standar Deviation)]. So for example “tBodyAcc-mean()-X” becomes “time_BodyMotion_Accelerometer_Xaxis_Mean”

Why is this descriptive? Because even though working with these signals and filtering them requires advanced mathematics and physics knowledge, any person who reads this document will know at least:
	-Type/Source of movement
	-Domain of the variable (frequency or time)
	-Source of readings (sensor's name)
	-If it's the magnitude of the vector or an Axis
	-Estimation type (mean or standard deviation)

It's also expected that a Data Scientist working with a data set with such descriptions will have a better change of recalling the use of each variable.
